lua-shell
=========

**lua-shell** (working title) is an attempt at harnessing the power of Lua for use as a
Unix shell. Thus, the goals of the project are:

* To provide an intuitive interface to external programs, including system utilities such as `ls` and `sudo` as well as other CLI tools, in a consistent manner.
* To provide facilities for creating command pipelines in order to take advantage of the Unix philosophy of combining small, specialized programs to complete a complex task.
* To provide an improved REPL, compared to the default one of Lua's interactive interpreter.
